<p>
SUSE Manager started as a product based on Spacewalk (as developed by
Red Hat as the upstream of their Satellite product). During recent years
the SUSE Manager team extended the Spacewalk backend to be based on
Salt, the open source configuration management software (as developed by
SaltStack Inc.). The SUSE Manager team is steadily making contributions
to both of these projects as well as to many other smaller projects.
